# YOLOv9-C Intoxication Detection: Early Drunkenness Detection Based on Facial Expressions
This project focuses on the application of the YOLOv9-C algorithm for detecting early symptoms of intoxication based on facial expressions. By leveraging a dataset sourced from Roboflow Universe, annotated with bounding boxes, the study aims to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of YOLOv9-C in real-time scenarios.

The research follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework and compares YOLOv9-C's performance against other object detection models, such as GELAN-C and Detectron2. Key performance metrics, including mAP50, mAP50-95, precision, and recall, demonstrate that YOLOv9-C excels in detecting subtle facial cues associated with alcohol consumption.

Key Features:
- Model: YOLOv9-C (integrating GELAN for optimized multi-level feature extraction).
- Use Case: Real-time facial expression analysis for early detection of intoxication.
- Dataset: Drunk and sober face images, annotated for training and testing.
- Performance: Superior inference speed and detection accuracy, making it suitable for time-critical applications like driver monitoring and safety systems.
